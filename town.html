    <h1>Frýdek-Místek</h1>
    <p>Frýdek-Místek is a medium sized town in the Czech Republic. It's situated at the bottom of the Beskydy mountain range, close to the Polish border. While this is the place where I was born, I didn't really grow up there - but I still spent a couple of years living there. Like many Czech towns, it's rich in history as it has been around since Medieval times. If you look at the images below, you can see the local castle as well as an example of the era's architecture <em>(fun fact: many older districts in Czech towns and cities still have cobblestone tiled roads)</em>. The town's location is absolutely stunning, as it's situated in a beautiful valley between the mountains. There is also a lake that people can go boating on, but unfortunately swimming is prohibited as it's too dangerous.</p>

    <h1 style="margin-top: 70px;">What to Do There?</h1>
    <p>Since Frýdek-Místek is quite small, there isn't anything too exciting in the town itself. There are a couple of bars, restaurants, even a minigolf course and an aquatic centre, but those things aren't truly representative of the area. However, just a 15-minute drive in any direction from the town can take you to many authentic locations, both modern and historical. Below are some examples of the many unique places that you can experience. <em>Click on the images to learn more about each place.</em></p>

        <h2 class="place-title">Mining Museum Landek Park</h2>
        <p>Follow in the workers' footsteps and explore one of the country's earliest coal mines. This mine is unique as it contains an archeological site where a 30,000 year old settlement of mammoth hunters was discovered!</p>

        <h2 class="place-title">New City Hall Viewing Tower</h2>
        <p>While the Old City Hall Tower can still be found in the city, this newly constructed one happens to be the tallest in the country! It offers a breathtaking view of the nearby mountains, and if the day is free of clouds, you can even see into Poland!</p>

        <h2 class="place-title">Silesian Ostrava Castle</h2>
        <p>Like any proper Czech town, this one has it's own castle too. Centuries ago it would have housed the local nobility, but today most of these castles offer tours, or have been converted into museums to showcase what life was like back then.</p>
