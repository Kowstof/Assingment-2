    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Krystof! (or Kry≈°tof if you want to be pedantic). I'm originally Czech, but I've spent the last 7 years in Australia (and another 6 before than in Spain, and a lot of other countries, but that's a story for another day). I moved from the Northern Rivers to Sydney to study, meet new people and finally live in my own place.
    <p>In my spare time, there's an absolutely huge list of things I like to do, but lately I've been doing a lot of 3D printing and cooking. I also love to play and record music, but I'm missing some equipment that didn't fit in the car during the move here - I'll have to bring it down next time I visit home. As you can probably guess from this website, web design is something I enjoy and have been doing as a hobby for the past couple of years. I hope to major in interaction design at UTS and see where it takes me!</p>
    </p>
