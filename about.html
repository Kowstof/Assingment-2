    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Yeah yeah I know, I'll write something proper when I feel like it. Now, the assignment outline defines this section as a place for "anything I want to tell others about yourself". I don't really know what to put here, as I don't think anyone really likes talking about themselves. Instead, I'll try to fill it
      with as much related as text as possible that still makes sense and forms a cohesive paragraph - after all, I'm not getting assessed on my writing skills but rather my HTML and CSS skills. So yeah, I think I'm getting close to making a paragaph
      of a size that will the space out nicely, just a few more words and I'm done.</p>
