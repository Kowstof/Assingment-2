      <h1>Music Making</h1>
      <p>A little after I started learning piano I discovered I could use my keyboard to control virtual instruments on my computer and get many more sounds this way. It also allowed me to record individual layers and edit/arrange them how I want. While I haven't made any full songs yet, in the player on the right is a small collection of ideas that I have recorded over time.</p>
      <p>The simplest answer as to why I like it is because it's fun. It's always really rewarding learning a new song, or making some music you're really proud of. It's especially enjoyable when playing with others as everyone has their own ideas to bring to the table.</p>
      <p>As to what advanatges it brings me, there isn't a simple answer. I could argue that it improves my sense of rhythm, and precision, but the truth is that I'm doing it because it's fun, the only thing I'm looking to gain is enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
